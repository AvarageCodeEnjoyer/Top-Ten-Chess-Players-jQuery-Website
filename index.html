                  Sergey Karjakin is an elite chess player who broke the record of youngest-ever GM at 12 years and seven months of age in 2003. Karjakin held his record until 2021 when GM Abhimanyu Mishra broke his record.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Most notably, he pushed GM Magnus Carlsen—typically considered one of the two greatest chess players of all time (along with GM Garry Kasparov)—to tiebreakers in the 2016 World Chess Championship. Karjakin nearly won the most prestigious title in chess to go along with two world titles in rapid (2012) and blitz (2016) that came at the expense of the world champion.

                Viswanathan Anand, the 15th undisputed chess champion and surely the greatest Indian chess player of all time, was born on Dec. 11, 1969 in Mayiladuthurai in Tamil Nadu, the southeastern most state in India.
                <br>
                <br>
                Anand, noted for playing quickly early in his career, competed for the classical championship in 1995 and was FIDE champion from 2000-2002 before claiming the reunited title in 2007. He held that title for six years until 2013 and has also had a productive post-championship career at an age when many other top players have retired.

                  Wesley So is a Filipino-American super grandmaster who is among the world's best chess players. He began as a chess prodigy who entered tournaments at nine years old. At 14, he became the ninth youngest GM in history. The next year, he became the youngest player to pass the 2600 rating threshold, breaking Magnus Carlsen's record.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So's peak rating of 2822 in March 2017 made him the number-two player in the world behind Carlsen. It also earned his place as the fifth highest-rated player ever, trailing only Carlsen, Garry Kasparov, Fabiano Caruana, and Levon Aronian. Later, in 2019, So won the first-ever FIDE-sanctioned Fischer Random World Chess Championship after routing Carlsen 13.5-2.5 in the final. In February 2021, he became a U.S. citizen.

                  This grandmaster has had a ranking as high as number-two in the world and has won numerous tournaments in his career.

                  Hikaru Nakamura was born December 9, 1987 in Hirakata, Japan. His family moved to the United States when he was just two years old, and the Stars and Stripes are the only national banner he has known as a chess player.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Nakamura has been one of the world's top players for well over a decade. He was clearly the top American player for much of that time and is now a key contributor to one of the strongest chess scenes in the world.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  He is a five-time U.S. champion, claiming the title in 2005, 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2019. Nakamura was also a participant in FIDE's 2004 World Championship tournament and a candidate for the world championship in both 2016 and 2022. He was also the 2022 Fischer Random World Champion. As of November 2022, he is the highest-rated blitz player in the world with a 2909 FIDE blitz rating.

                  Alireza Firouzja is an Iranian-born grandmaster who now plays for France. He is a world championship candidate and two-time Iranian champion.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In late 2019 and early 2020, Firouzja electrified the chess world with his second place finish in the World Rapid Championship (one point behind World Champion Magnus Carlsen) and his amazing 5/7 start at the 2020 Tata Steel tournament.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Firouzja's trajectory continued to shoot up in 2021, when he won the Riga Grand Swiss, scored 8/9 and the European Team Championships, and skyrocketed to #2 in the world rankings with a 2804 rating. His Grand Swiss victory qualified Firouzja for the 2022 Candidates Tournament at the age of 18, one of the youngest ever to achieve that feat, and Firouzja also broke the record for youngest player to surpass a 2800 rating.

Nepomniachtchi also has positive records against GM Anatoly Karpov (+2 -0 =0 in 2013) and GM Garry Kasparov (+2 -0 =3 from 2017-21) in rapid/blitz, the only formats he has played them in.

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Ding won his first Chinese Chess Championship at the age of 16, making him the youngest to ever do so. In the 2017 and 2019 Chess World Cup, he became the first player in history to reach the finals twice in a row. The latter result means that Ding would play in the 2020 Candidates Tournament, which decided who gets a shot at the world title.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Having only turned 30 in October 2022, Ding has already amassed an impressive chess resume. His three Chinese titles are joined by two team gold medals and one individual gold medal at the Chess Olympiads (plus one team gold medal at the World Team Championships).
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  From August 2017 to November 2018, Ding held a 100-game unbeaten streak in top-level chess competition—the longest in history until GM Magnus Carlsen broke it in October 2019. In 2018, Ding entered the world's top-five chess players (May) and broke the 2800-rating mark (September), and he remains in those categories today.

                GM Magnus Carlsen is the current world chess champion. To many people, he's the best to ever play the game, although GMs Garry Kasparov and Bobby Fischer remain in the conversation. At any rate, the clear and remarkable point is that before turning 30 years old, Carlsen has already earned a spot at the top.
                <br>
                <br>
                It's easy to see why. The 13-year-old Norwegian prodigy drew Kasparov and defeated GM Anatoly Karpov at the same event in 2004, one month before he became the second-youngest GM in history (and still eighth-youngest as of 2021). In 2009, he became the youngest player to break the 2800-rating threshold (a record only broken by GM Alireza Firouzja in 2021).
                <br>
                <br>
                Then Carlsen transitioned from young world-class player to all-time great. He captured the world number-one ranking in 2011 and still hasn't let go of it. He won the world title in 2013 and has successfully defended it four times (2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021). Additionally, he has won multiple world titles in rapid (twice) and blitz (four times) time controls, achieved the highest rating ever, and racked up several elite tournament wins, including four Norway Chess victories and seven in

                <br>
                <br>
                The amazing part is it seems like there's much more ahead for Carlsen. In October 2020 Carlsen's 125-game undefeated streak came to an end (he scored 42 wins and 83 draws during this streak), setting yet another world record. If he continues performing the way he has, Carlsen could create something truly legendary. In an era of chess that's more competitive than ever, he's far ahead of the opposition.
